This is our first android project .
Idea on which we are working from few weeks -
1-Inspiration:-
When ever some social issues related to pollution, Electricity , Water or, some other things we generally discuss about this but we generally don't try to stop them.
But if we report this problem the Government then may government can do something to resolve the problem and may this one report help us to make our society green.

So Our team decide to solve this problem through our Android application 'CiviHelper'.
We are trying to create a useful app for our society, In this way we started working on this project 'CiviHleper' .


We first try to make a simple user friendly interface in our app, so that pepole can easily intract with our app and can report easily.
I our app user hase to first login throug his/her G-mail or, any other E-mail I'd.
After the successful authentication by google authentication ,A user data created and stored in firebase server.
Then after people can choose any kine of problem to report.
Some main social issues listed on our main page as 4 diffrent button and one another button is used for report about something diffrent thing.
After clicking on any of these 5 button a new user interface appear named as-"form" while we creating it in Android studio.
In the form activity user can describe his/her issue in brief and can add the address of the related place and it's Postal Code.
After that pepole can select a picture form phone's gallery and can upload it by clicking "upload" button.
After uploading picture pepole has to simple click on submit button and the report is simple save in our firebase server.
On our main screen a floating button also appears which is for Simple Help related to our application.
on our main page a side bar also appears from where pepole can see there username and email id,a About us button,Share ,Rate Us,Login, Dark mode button also.
